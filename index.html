                technology practices. The technology support services it provides
                include four main areas: learning design (consultations and
                instructional design of all online, blended and in-classroom
                instruction), learning technologies (support of Canvas and other
                technologies that are used for teaching and learning), professional
                development (various types of individual and group sessions to build the
                capacity) and innovation (MOOCs, Summer Institutes, VR, TLEF granted
                projects, etc.).
            </p>
            <p>
                As a member of the ETS team, the Educational Technologist works with

                all aspects of creation of learning modules, courses and assessment
                tools, as well as conversion to an online medium. The incumbent will
                provide support and assistance in relation to flexible, online and

                and develops online training resources, ensuring that technologies
                appropriately, effectively, consistently and sustainably support the
                educational objectives in various programs across the Faculty of
                Education.

            <p>
                Errors in judgment may result in the inefficient use of resources, and
                may damage the image and reputation of the University, and the
                Educational Technology Support unit. As a service unit in the Faculty of
                Education, the consequence of staff error could negatively impact the
                reputation of the Faculty for quality and reliability and affect the
                enrollment of students. Difficulties in exercise of judgment,
                due-diligence and communication will be detrimental to the ETS unit.
